      <p class="text-capitalize text-muted text-left" >Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game[1] that aims to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, 
        entertainment to spectators.[2] Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve one's physical health. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, 
        either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. 
        Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. 
        Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.
        Sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition.[3] Other organisations, such as the Council of Europe, 
        preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sports.[2] However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. 
        The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, 
        and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), 
        Go and xiangqi,[4][5] and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.[1]
        Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. 
        It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.
        Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, 
        with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. 
        Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.
        According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013.[6] The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is the most popular spectator sport.

        Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball 
        (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) 
        while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. 
        A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, 
        when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, 
        two or three one-point free throws. 
        The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, 
        but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.

          Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, 
          kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used.  
          Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); 
          gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; 
          rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.
          [1] These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.
          There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.
          [2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.
          [5][6] The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.
          [7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: 
          Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, 
          The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. 
          During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.[9]

            Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, 
            each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler, "bowls" (propels) the ball from one end of the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, 
            with an "over" being completed once they have legally done so six times. The batting side has one player at each end of the pitch, 
            with the player at the opposite end of the pitch from the bowler aiming to strike the ball with a bat. 
            The batting side scores runs either when the ball reaches the boundary of the field, or when the two batters swap ends of the pitch, which results in one run. 
            The fielding side's aim is to prevent run-scoring and dismiss each batter (so they are "out", and are said to have "lost their wicket"). 
            Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the bowled ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching a hit ball before it touches the ground, 
            or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket to complete a run. 
            When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.
            Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs and the game generally lasting three hours, to Test matches played over five days. 
            Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, 
            which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.
            The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. 
            The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. 
            The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australasia, the United Kingdom, southern Africa and the West Indies.[1]
            Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, 
            which has won seven One Day International trophies, including five World Cups, more than any other country and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country.

              Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. 
              Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.
              [1] It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. 
              Beach volleyball was introduced to the programme at the Atlanta 1996. 
              The adapted version of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting volleyball.
              The complete set of rules is extensive,[2] but play essentially proceeds as follows: 
              a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), 
              from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court.[3] The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. 
              The team may touch the ball up to three times (one player cannot double touch the ball) to return the ball to the other side of the court, but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively.
              [3] Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack. An attack is an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the team receiving the ball is unable to pass the ball and continue the rally, thus, losing the point. 
              The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally. A few of the most common faults include:
